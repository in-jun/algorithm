### 문제 설명

<p>To encourage customers to shop more, some stores charge lower prices if you buy multiples of an item. For example, if you buy one, it may cost you <span>$</span>5 but if you buy two, it will cost you <span>$</span>8 instead of <span>$</span>10.</p>

<p>Let’s assume a store provides discounts as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>No discount if you buy only one.</li>
	<li><span>$</span>2 discount for each additional item if you buy more than one.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the number of items a customer has purchased and the price for one item, you are to compute the total cost for the customer.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of customers to check. The customers are on the following n input lines, one customer per line. Each line provides two integers; the first integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 100) is the number of items purchased by the customer, and the second integer p (3 ≤ p ≤ 50) is the price for one item.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each customer, print two lines of output. The first line will contain the two input values separated by a single space. The second output line will contain the total cost for the customer. There should be no leading or trailing spaces on any output line.</p>
