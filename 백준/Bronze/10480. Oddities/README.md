### 문제 설명

<p>Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number 3 is odd, because it is not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number n can be expressed as n = 2 ∗ k for some integer k, then n is even. For example, 6 = 2 ∗ 3 is even.</p>

<p>Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the query “is zero even or odd?” (Don’t search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)</p>

<p>Write a program to help these confused people.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input begins with an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each of the following n lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer −10 ≤ x ≤ 10.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each x, print either ‘x is odd’ or ‘x is even’ depending on whether x is odd or even.</p>
