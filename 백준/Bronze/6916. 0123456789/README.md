### 문제 설명

<pre> _     _  _       _   _  _   _   _
| | |  _| _| |_| |_  |_   | |_| |_|
|_| | |_  _|   |  _| |_|  | |_|  _|</pre>

<p>Most digital devices show numbers using a seven segment display. The seven segments are arranged as shown:</p>

<pre> * * *
*     *
*     *
*     *
 * * *
*     *
*     *
*     *
 * * *</pre>

<p>For this problem, each segment is represented by three asterisks in a line as shown above.</p>

<p>Any digit from 0 - 9 can be shown by illuminating the appropriate segments. For example, the digit 1 may be displayed using the two segments on the right side:</p>

<pre>      *
      *
      *

      *
      *
      *</pre>

<p>The digit 4 needs four segments to display it properly:</p>

<pre>*     *
*     *
*     *
 * * *
      *
      *
      *</pre>

<p>Write a program that will accept a single digit input from the user, and then display that digit using a seven segment display. You may assume that each segment is composed of three asterisks.</p>

<p><strong>BOJ-specific note: None of your lines should contain any trailing whitespace. The last line must end with a newline.</strong></p>
