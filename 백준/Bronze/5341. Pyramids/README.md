<p>You must calculate the number of blocks needed to construct a pyramid given the size of the base. For example, a pyramid that has a base of size 4 will need a total of 10 blocks.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input will be a sequence of integers, one per line. The end of input will be signaled by the integer 0, and does not represent the base of a pyramid. All integers, other than the last (zero), are positive.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each positive integer print the total number of blocks needed to build the pyramid with the specified base.</p>
