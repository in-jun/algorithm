<p>To encourage customers to conserve energy (and protect the environment), the electric companies typically have a lower rate for the first 1000 kilowatt-hour (KWH) of electric usage and a higher rate for the additional usage (KWH is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules).</p>

<p>Given the rate (per KWH) for the first 1000 KWH usage, the rate (per KWH) for the additional usage, and a customer’s energy consumption, you are to determine the charges (bill) for the customer.</p>

The next input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of customers to process. Each of the following n input lines contains an integer (between 1 and 50000, inclusive), indicating a customer’s energy consumption.</p>
