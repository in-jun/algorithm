### 문제 설명

<p>Here at the Concerned Citizens of Commerce (CCC), we have noted that telemarketers like to use seven-digit phone numbers where the last four digits have three properties. Looking just at the last four digits, these properties are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the first of these four digits is an 8 or 9;</li>
	<li>the last digit is an 8 or 9;</li>
	<li>the second and third digits are the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the last four digits of the telephone number are 8229, 8338, or 9008, these are telemarketer numbers.</p>

<p>Write a program to decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not, based on the last four digits. If the number is not a telemarketer number, we should answer the phone, and otherwise, we should ignore it.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input will be 4 lines where each line contains exactly one digit in the range from 0 to 9.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output either ignore if the number matches the pattern for a telemarketer number; otherwise, output answer.</p>
