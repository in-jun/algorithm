### 문제 설명

<p>A fish-finder is a device used by anglers to find fish in a lake. If the fish-finder finds a fish, it will sound an alarm. It uses depth readings to determine whether to sound an alarm. For our purposes, the fish-finder will decide that a fish is swimming past if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there are four consecutive depth readings which form a strictly increasing sequence (such as 3 4 7 9) (which we will call “Fish Rising”), or</li>
	<li>there are four consecutive depth readings which form a strictly decreasing sequence (such as 9 6 5 2) (which we will call “Fish Diving”), or</li>
	<li>there are four consecutive depth readings which are identical (which we will call “Constant Depth”).</li>
</ul>

<p>All other readings will be considered random noise or debris, which we will call “No Fish.”</p>

<p>Your task is to read a sequence of depth readings and determine if the alarm will sound.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input will be four positive integers, representing the depth readings. Each integer will be on its own line of input.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output is one of four possibilities. If the depth readings are increasing, then the output should be <code>Fish Rising</code>. If the depth readings are decreasing, then the output should be <code>Fish Diving</code>. If the depth readings are identical, then the output should be <code>Fish At Constant Depth</code>. Otherwise, the output should be <code>No Fish</code>.</p>
